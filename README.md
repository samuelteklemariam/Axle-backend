# Axle-backend

This is the code for the backend of the Asphalt-Axle e-commerse application

In this code, there are all the APIs that I used to connect the frontend and the backend to the admin pannel and 
the Mongodb database of the web application that houses all the product file. 
This code contains the 
- API to create the user login
- API for uploading images
- API for deleting a product
- API for getting all products
- API for creating a user
- API for new collections

Thunder clinet was used to test the APIs functionality

### Run

To run the backend of the application, download the files from this repository and open the folder from 
Vs Code or another editor and open the terminal. If the terminal is not already in the backend folder, navigate 
to the folder where the backend files are and run the command "node .\index.js".
